William Engels was born in 1997 in San Diego, California.

From 2015-2018 he attended the University of Chicago, where he earned a Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy and completed coursework in neuroscience, human development, and computer science.

After graduation, he launched a new venture called SinkGuard, a healthcare device startup that eventually earned national accelerator investment, five-figure pitch competition funding, and acceptance into the prestigious MATTER Healthcare Incubator.

He is currently (2023) exploring the application of data science to hard problems in healthcare, such as the prediction of chronic illnesses and the computer-aided diagnosis of cancer.

Pursuant to his interest in philosophy, he maintains a [Substack page](https://williamengels.substack.com) where he writes detailed but accessible biographies of people who were oppressed for their beliefs.
